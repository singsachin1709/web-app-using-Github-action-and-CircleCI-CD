# web-application-using-Github-action-and-circleCI-CD

## 📌 Objective
As part of the DevOps role assessment, the task is to demonstrate the ability to set up and automate a deployment pipeline for a web application (Flask, Node.js, or any other simple web app).
## ⚙️ Requirements
- Web Application
  - Flask (preferred) or Node.js (or any other simple web app).
  - Containerized using Docker.
- CI/CD Pipeline
  - Use GitHub Actions or CircleCI (preferred tools).
  - Automate build, test, and deployment stages.
  - Deploy to Kubernetes (can be local with Minikube, Kind, or remote cluster).
- Monitoring Consideration
  - Showcase how monitoring could be integrated to avoid resource underutilization or overutilization (brief mention or example).
 
## 🚀 Deliverables
- Code Repository containing:
  - Application source code.
  - Dockerfile for containerization.
  - CI/CD pipeline configuration (.github/workflows/ or .circleci/config.yml).
  - Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yaml, service.yaml, etc.).

## 📝 Suggested Steps
- Set up the Web App
  - Build a simple Flask or Node.js app that returns “Hello World”.
- Containerize with Docker
  - Write a Dockerfile and build/push the image.
- Set up CI/CD Pipeline
  - Configure GitHub Actions or CircleCI workflow.
  - Add steps for build, test, Docker image build, and deployment to Kubernetes.
- Deploy to Kubernetes
  - Write manifests (deployment.yaml, service.yaml, ingress.yaml).
  - Deploy on Minikube, Kind, or a cloud provider (EKS, GKE, AKS).
